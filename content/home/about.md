I was born in Indonesia and completed my engineering degree in Singapore. I worked in the industry as an electronic engineer where I successfully completed several turn-key manufacturing projects both locally and overseas. Subsequently, I moved to Montreal (Canada) in 2012 for my doctoral degree at McGill University. Upon graduating, I take up a position as a Research Fellow back in Singapore.
